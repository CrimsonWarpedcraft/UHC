### Issue Templates üìã
* Bug report template
* Feature request template

### Gradle Builds üèó

### Config Files üìÅ
* Sample plugin.yml with auto-fill fields
* Simple Gradle build config
* Empty config.yml (just to make life \*that\* much easier)
* Simple .gitignore for common Gradle files

## Setup
In order to use this template for yourself, there are a few things that you will need to change.

I've broken the changes up by their files to make things a bit easier to find.

### settings.gradle
Update the line below with the name of your plugin.

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'ExamplePlugin'
```

### build.gradle
Make sure to update the `group` to your package's name in the following section.

```groovy
group = "com.snowypeaksystems.exampleplugin"
```

Add any required repositories for your dependencies in the following section.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        name 'papermc'
        url 'https://papermc.io/repo/repository/maven-public/'
    }
}
```

Also, update your dependencies as needed (of course).

```groovy
dependencies {
    spotbugsPlugins 'com.h3xstream.findsecbugs:findsecbugs-plugin:1.10.1'
    compileOnly group: 'com.destroystokyo.paper', name: 'paper-api', version: '1.16.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT'
    implementation group: 'io.papermc', name: 'paperlib', version: '1.0.5'
}
```

### .github/draft.yml
In the following section, you will need to replace "ExamplePlugin.jar" in `asset_path` and `asset_name` with the name of your plugin (see [settings.gradle](#settingsgradle)).

```yml
- name: Upload Release Asset
  uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
    asset_path: ${{ github.workspace }}/build/libs/ExamplePlugin.jar
    asset_name: ExamplePlugin.jar
    asset_content_type: application/java-archive
```

### src/main/resources/plugin.yml
First, update the following with your information.

```yml
author: AUTHOR
description: DESCRIPTION
```

Next, the `commands` and `permissions` sections below should be updated as needed.

```yml
commands:
  ex:
    description: Base command for EXAMPLE
    usage: "For a list of commands, type /ex help"
    aliases: example
permissions:
  example.test:
    description: DESCRIPTION
    default: true
  example.*:
    description: Grants all other permissions
    default: false
    children:
      example.test: true
```

### .github/dependabot.yml
You will need to change all instances of `leviem1`, such as the one below, with your GitHub username.

```yml
reviewers:
  - "leviem1"
```

## Creating a Release
Below are the steps you should follow to create a release.

1. Create a tag on `main` using semantic versioning (e.g. v0.1.0)
2. Push the tag and get some coffee while the workflows run
3. Add a description to the release draft once it's been automatically created

## Contributing
### General workflow
1. First, pull any changes from `main` to make sure you're up-to-date
2. Create a branch from `main`
    * Give your branch a name that describes your change (e.g. add-scoreboard)
    * Focus on one change per branch
    * Keep your commits small, and write descriptive commit messages
3. When you're ready, create a pull request to `main` with a descriptive title, and listing any changes made in its description
    * Link any issues that your pull request is related to as well

#### Example:
```
Create scoreboard for total points

ADDED - Scoreboard displayed in-game at game end  
CHANGED - Updated `StorageManager` class to persist scoreboard data
```

After the pull request has been reviewed, approved, and passes all automated checks, it will be merged into main.

### Building locally
Thanks to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), building locally is easy no matter what platform you're on. Simply run the following command:

#### macOS/Linux/Unix/
`./gradlew build`

#### Windows
`gradlew.bat build`

This build step will also run all checks, making sure your code is clean.

I think that's all... phew!
